                In this day of the technological age, the E-commerce system has been one of the best alternatives for buying and selling things. Also, everything else has been transferred to the online media. So, to help bring the transaction of computers and other devices online along with an online appointment system, our team is trying to develop a web-based system that will act as an e-commerce and appointment system.<br><br><br>
                Computer Service System is the system that will help users to buy/sell laptops and other devices like a basic e-commerce website, also it will help the users to get an appointment with the technician to get their computers fixed. Nowadays, E-commerce has been very popular and very much reliable to all internet users as it saves up most of the time and even money sometimes. This system will use HTML/CSS + PHP +[optional] JS as our programming language in order to develop this system.<br><br><br>

                Computer Service System  will be divided into two parts i.e., basic e-commerce and appointment side. Anyone can register/login to the system in order to get access to the services provided by the system. The main feature that can be accessed by the user is buying laptops according to their preference, also making an appointment to repair their computers and other devices. From the side of the administration, anyone with the login and password can log in as an admin. The admin can handle various things related to the site.  The admin will have the access to the database of the products available, approve appointments  according to the appropriate date and time.
